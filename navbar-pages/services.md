# Does your website bring in more customers or does it repel them?

I know it sounds a bit dramatic when put like this, but it's usually one or the other. And you can measure it.

I'm Vitor and I <span class="highlight">help companies grow</span> by creating websites that allow them to deploy powerful marketing strategies.

See, [it takes around 0.05 seconds][50mstojudge] for us to decide whether we're going to stay on a website or if we're gonna close that tab and check out the competition.

And if your website [takes more than 3 seconds to load][3secondstoload], you've already lost 53% of your visitors right then.

## Why does this matter to you?

Now, the reason you should care about this is because you might be burning your hard earned money trying to make your marketing strategy work on a broken site.

I mean, if you're paying for traffic, that's more than half your advertising budget down the drain.

That's far from ideal, right?

And that's if we're only talking about performance... Leaving out responsiveness, conversion, SEO, accessibility and much more.

I know, this sounds like a lot and you can't really stop your day to day management activities to take care of this stuff.

Well...

## Here's how I can help you

Over the last 5 years I've specialised in building and growing online businesses in a variety of industries.

That includes building a new lead acquisition system for a celebrity clothes designer, creating the full marketing strategy for a software company and managing a network of eCommerce websites.

And as you probably imagine, a crucial step that all those projects had was building a new website, or new pages for a website, or improving an existing website.

But what usually happened is that businesses often got a website made when they opened up shop â€” several years before â€” and didn't really touch it again.

(Is this you?)

Then everything we had to do required much more time going around platform limitations and coming up with quick fixes to make everything work.

That meant more time and money to be added to the cost of the project for the busines owner.

And this is why I decided to change focus and specialise in building websites with a cutting edge structure, making them ready for that profitable marketing strategy you need to deploy.
