# Hey, I'm Vitor.

![Vitor smiling at you](/assets/img/vitor-profile-square.jpg "Vitor Acacio"){:class="aboutPage-img"}

I'm an international [marketing consultant](/services) to the online business industry (and to brick & mortar businesses that want to start selling online).

I'm also a hobbyist web dev just getting into blockchain, and proud pet-parent. 🐈

Here you'll find <span class="highlight">quick actionable lessons</span> from [the small business trenches](/smallbiz), as well as my <span class="highlight">live documented journey</span> on [building online products](/onlinebuilding), and the <span class="highlight">latest stuff I'm learning</span> about [blockchain & crypto](/blockchain).

If you're into that, I can [let you know](#) when I drop the next piece.

And if you wanna know more, this is [what I'm up to](/now) and the [projects](/projects) I'm involved with.

You can reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) and [telegram](https://t.me/{{ site.telegram_username }}) or over at {{ site.email }}.

Thanks for dropping by!

\- Vitor
