#### Work

It's been almost two years since I closed my eCommerce business and joined the company I'm currently at.

Since then, I've been dedicated to building amazing marketing campaigns for our private clients and delivering top notch online entrepreneurship training to our community.

Now I can say that I not only have done it for myself, but I've also helped other dozens build and grow online businesses too. So I'm making the time to take consulting clients again. This is one of the main reasons that made me want to start this website.


#### This website
After many years building websites for other people and having only an "under construction" page to show for myself, I'm finally getting it up. My main goal with it is to put myself out there and help people by sharing practical knowledge on areas that I'm experienced at.

Another reason is to get myself in the brain space of building more stuff online and learning with the doors open. This has been inspired by the ideas from [Nathan Barry][nathanbarry], [Swyx][swyx] and [Rob Walling][robwalling].


#### Business

I'll soon be starting some sort of online business as an experiment on building in public.

Successful or not, it will all be documented here. Including the step-by-step of how I'm doing it, the mistakes I'm making, and what I've learned in the past that's helping me this time.

#### Learning

I've been fascinated with the world of blockchain & crypto recently. And while trying to learn everything about it, I saw that the disorganised online information will only take you so far.

So I looked for the best guided path and decided to join the free online [MIT Blockchain & Money course][blockchain-mit]. It was offered in 2018 to business majors, so it's aimed at non-technical people. And that makes for a very good way to be introduced to such complex ideas.

I'll document what I'm learning on the course [here](/blockchain), as I get prepared to start building something around that area as well.
