# Web Development

#### Why I'm doing this

After coding this very website, I wanted to dive into coding to be able to build things and solve my own problems. And, of course, to be able to build online businesses around my own little software projects that I'll be working on.

I did some research and read that a good foundation on front-end will take you far. So I decided to go back all the way to square one and start with web design. It's time for a refresh anyway. There are many new techniques since I did a [Codecademy][codecademy] course on it in 2013. Also, there's some concepts that I never fully learned...

Take the CSS positioning for example. I only kinda know how it works. When it comes to using the `position` property on multiple elements, I lose track of the individual effects and just do the good old trial-and-error method until it works.

Truth is I only studied enough to be able to build my own simple blog. I completely abandoned it after I discovered WordPress. But that blog never got built.

A couple of years later, on my first marketing project for a client, I included a new website in the proposal because their old website didn't support a blog and downloadable lead magnets. It was the best and the worst beginner . I budgeted 30 days for building it. It took me 90.

So I chose [Free Code Camp][freecodecamp]'s certifications as a guided path of learning. They're a non-profit, payment / donations are optional, they have projects assignments and seem to have a complete curriculum for getting me fully refreshed.

I'll keep a journal of my progress here.

Activity Log:

- *05/06/21*: started and finished the first module in [Responsive Web Design][responsive-web-design], the one on Basic HTML and HTML5.

- *06/06/21*:
    - Finished the module on Basic CSS and got halfway through Applied Visual Design.
    - [Finally learned how CSS positioning works!][css-positioning-twitter-thread]
    - Decided that I'll do these lessons for 30 days straight, inspired by [Josh Branchaud][30-days-of-x].
    - Considering tracking my study time with Toggl, but I don't usually like adding new daily tools to my workflow. Let's experiment and see if it has any benefits.

- *07/06/21*: Got stuck in adult life bureaucracy and didn't have much time to study. Made sure to put in at least half an hour at the end of the day. My mind was already slow, so I was only able to do a couple lessons, but ended up finding out that there are more ways to define colors in CSS than only hex and rgb and that combining a color with that same color but on a different tone (using hsl) can look good.

- *08/06/21*: Finished the Applied Visual Design module. All those years getting mad when inspecting elements that were created using the ::after pseudo class because I didn't understand it have come to an end. I also learned how to create visual elements with CSS and do animation, which is actually much easier that it looks. Except from the Bezier curve. It's hard to wrap your head around that, but fortunately we have [Bezier curves generators][bezier-curve-generator] that let you visually create it and just copy the coordinates.

- *09/06/21*: Finished the Applied Accessibility module. Learned a lot about how visually impaired users browser the web, the types of challenges they meet and how you can prevent that from happening by building an inclusive website. The thing is if you don't have this as a requirement when start building the website, implementing it afterwards actually means rebuilding all of the HTML. Found out that in the US, people get sued for not having an accessible website, and that there are companies that specialise in keeping websites compliant to the rules relating to that. One of them is even publicly traded, with a turnover $50M / year turnover. It seems like an interesting market.
