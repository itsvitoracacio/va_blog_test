# This Website

Making this website was something that I had put off for way too long. And I knew what were the reasons, so I set a few requirements before getting started:

- I just didn't want to use WordPress
- I was gonna code it myself & have full control over all its features
- Simple design
- Complete focus on the main written content
- No ongoing maintenance
- No ongoing costs

Within a week I had a basic version up, and it took me about a month to complete it.

I had stopped coding websites myself since I delivered my first client project in 2016 and switched to team & project management work.

To do it after such a long time, it gave me a nice refresh on the hands-on web dev practice and it sparked my interest to dive deeper into programming.

###### Here's some of the cool features I was able to implement:

- *Lightning speed:* it has a 10/10 score in performance testing tools and takes 1.3s to load, which is key for UX and SEO.
- *Actually related blog posts:* the related posts section automatically shows all other posts that link to that one.
- *Multi-language with an easy switch:* some of the posts are for only one language, so they don't appear in the other language lists.
- *Compartmentalised code:* makes it super easy to make website-level changes. The parts of the code that repeat across multiple pages can be edited in a single place.

**Tech used:** HTML5 / CSS3 / SASS / Jekyll / Git / GitHub Pages
