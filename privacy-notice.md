# Privacy Notice

At the moment, [this](#) is the only page that lets me collect any data from you. And I don't use any type of website activity tracker, so the only data it collects is what you actively submit: your **name** and **email address**.

I'll never sell or share you email address with anyone, or use it to spam you. If you wish to unsubscribe for whatever reason, you can do so at anytime. I can also delete the data I may have on you if you want. Just ask me on {{ site.email }}.

As for the third party providers that help me run this website:

- *ConvertKit* powers my email communication. They say that [they won't sell your data](https://convertkit.com/privacy), but they may share it with their service providers, who also need to comply with their privacy policy.

- *GitHub Pages* hosts this website. They say [they collect some data on you](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages), including logs of IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations and to maintain security of the service.

- I wasn't able to find out whether *Namecheap* [collects data on you or not](https://www.namecheap.com/legal/general/privacy-policy/). They're the ones who provide me the domain name.

All in all, this is still considerably less data collection than the average website we all use daily.

If any of the above changes at some point, I'll update this page as well.
